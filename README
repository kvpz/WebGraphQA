# About the packages

What does WG stand for?  Web Graph.  Why? Because it is the best quip I could use to describe what I am working towards.

*src/main/java/com.wg**
This folder will contain all the functions and programs for testing large portions of the website.  Tests here are considered
generic.  If the test cannot be applied across different websites, then it should not go here.  There should not be
any code that is written directly against a specific website.  As I write this sentence, the majority of the code is
dedicated to the google store.  The goal is to make these tests compatible with different websites. Refactors will be
accepted.

*/src/test/java/com.wgtest*
This folder will contain unit tests against the functions written under com.wg.

*/src/main/java/gstore*
This folder is dedicated to gstore.  It is a revamp of what is currently found under com.wg.  The difference is that
com.wg is a set of tests that can be run across various sets of data such as distinct groups of URLs or directories.  The
code under gstore will focus on writing tests (specifically) against what is available, that is, Pages, Modules, Carousels, etc.
Notice how Pages encapsulate modules, modules can encapsulate caorusels, and so on.  Right now I am writing
tests that can be applied to various pages.  If there is a test that is specific and unique to one page, then a separate
class should be written containing the test(s) for that page.  Tests should be written as specific to a page element as possible.
Generally it would be a good idea to write tests for modules and not entire pages.

## Design
This documentation was started after about 2 months writing tests against store.google.com.  Over this time period, I have expanded on the design a bit.
The following will be a description of how this project will be designed.

I wrote separate classes with a main method focusing on performing tests related.

The following tests performed:
Check for aria label values.  There is a test that will get all the values for aria label across the entire website and print them out.  I would then read them
checking:

Tests performed on copy:
    1) localization.  All the text that would be displayed in viewports is printed and manually analyzed.
    2) characters that are not in the localized language.  For example, there shouldn't be characters like ">" in the aria-label values.

    Text I was concerned:
        * text within the elements.  Calling Selenium's or JSoup's "text" function would return all this text.
        * the values of the aria-label attributes
        * a page's meta description element (found in the head element) <meta description="...">.  This copy can be seen on a search engine's results page
        * the value for the content attributes of the meta elements found in the HTML head.  Besides localization, it's important to make sure that these are relevant to the page.
        * values of the alt attributes. Again, it is important that these are relevant to the element they are a part of.


        Note: these pages must be analyzed under UTF-8 encoding. This must be declared when using JSoup's parse function which takes an argument
            asking the character encoding of the HTML document.

Tests performed on UI/ UX:
    1) Check for disappearing nav bar. There is a nav bar on the PDPs that would disappear after scrolling down the page
       and resizing the viewport.  It would reappear after scrolling back to the top and resizing the browser.  As of 07/05/2019, this is still an issue.
    2) link analysis.  Pages should always have a link.  All links should link to a valid page (not a 404 or redirect, which may signal as a 500 error)
    3) TODO: automatic slideshow (or carousel) rotation speed.  Each element should be displayed for the same amount of time.  I noticed that the rotations may vary for some carousels after
        scrolling up and down a page rapidly a few times.  A page that was victim of such a carousel is the Overview PDP for the Google Nest Learning Thermostat.
    4)

Helper functions:
    1) TODO: Auto-rotating carousel detection: be able to identify whether an element contains a carousel/ slideshow.  A method could be written that will return a signal if an element has undergone changes, or values
        have been updated.  I could start by the body HTML element, and every time a change is detected, I would proceed to the next child element.  This process can be continued
        until a change occurs in the currently selected outer html (the value for one of the tag's attributes would have to be changed).  Once one of these elements are detected (after a
        period of about 10 seconds), log the current element in a file  (for manual verification) to guarantee that it is not analyzed again.  Then, crawl back up the current
        branch (until a sibling can be found).  The repeat the process of crawling down the sibling branch until another autorotating carousel is detected or there is nothing left to crawl.
        This can all be packed into a function that will return an array of the outer html of elements.
    2) Get all modules.  Modules are div elements with a class attribute with the value "page-module."  This can be found under the Modules class.
